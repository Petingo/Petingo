Hi, I'm Petingo, a Master student in Computer Science at EPFL, Switzerland.

Meanwhile, I'm also working as a research assistant at [IBOIS](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/augmented-reality-as-a-tool-for-construction/) for an AR application for carpentry and [LDM](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ldm/) for an research on AI-aided architectural design.

If you want to know more about me, please check my [website](https://petingo.ch/) or my [résumé](https://cv.petingo.ch/).
